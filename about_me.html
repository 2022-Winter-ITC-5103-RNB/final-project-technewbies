      <h2 class="briefHistory">
        Vincent Van-Dog is well known for his artistic conception of the world. He won the most important reward
        in the animal painting category. Furthermore, he established his career in Canada, where he hosts
        several events across the country and encourages residents to visit his Toronto-based art gallery.
        <br>
        <br>
        Since he was a puppy, Van-Dog always has shown interest in arts, he's had a unique vision and usually
        expressed himself in his own way. Additionally, his exquisite taste for arts has led him to the Liberal
        School of Arts in Europe, where he improved his skills and learned new techniques.
        <br>
        <br>
        No matter the size of the project, his art always have been a manifestation of his personal spiritual
        journey. His mission is to inspire every person deeply and connect the audience
        and their life journey. In other words, he definitely makes art to encourage people to live in their
        best
        and deep way.
